# WEB-LivingGreen-Blogs
Website for a sustainable living blog

Purpose: This website was an assignment for an Advanced Web Design course. A photoshop file was provided and used as a guide to build this website from scratch. 

Bugs: 
- Drop down menus do not function as intended.
- Tiny Living image floats out of maximum view width on large screens
